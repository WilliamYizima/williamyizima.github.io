I"‡<p>Well, I guess itâ€™s quite obvious that I really enjoy working with Jekyll â€” with good reasons â€” so let me just briefly suggest some of the benefits of using a static site generator in favor of a heavy dynamic, database driven content management system.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Speed</strong>: Static HTML pages are small, lightweight and perform blazingly fast. Youâ€™ll notice the difference.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Version Control</strong>: Contents and files remain on your computer. Perform backups or keep track of changes via GIT or SVN â€” <em>itâ€™s quite easy without a database.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Ruby and Liquid â€” <em>Jekyllâ€™s foundation</em> â€” empower you to easily extend its functionality. Or just use one of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/">many plugins</a> created by a striving community.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Security</strong>: Anything youâ€™ll ever put on your server are static files â€” chances are good that <em>youâ€™ll never need to worry</em> about security concerns anymore.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If that still doesnâ€™t convince you to at least give it a try, Iâ€™d like to encourage you to head over to the Jekyll website and see it for yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Heck, itâ€™s that good</strong> â€” I even wrote all of the guides for the theme documentation with it!</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
